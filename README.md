🔐 Caesar Cipher – Python GUI Implementation
This project is part of my Skill Craft Cybersecurity Internship – Task 1. It demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt text using the classical Caesar Cipher algorithm through a Python Tkinter GUI.

📌 Features
🔒 Encrypt plain text using a shift value

🔓 Decrypt cipher text to retrieve the original message

🖥️ User-friendly Tkinter interface

✅ Input validation for shift values (1–25)

▶️ How to Run
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

🧠 About Caesar Cipher
The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. It’s one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.
